      \item Added a 3-character string after \texttt{surf} to denote
        the kind of boundary condition that surface is (DIR, NEU, NUL,
        ABC,\ldots)
      \item Added to the surface set the surfaces involved in FE-IIEE
        method, denoted as \texttt{fe-iiee-local-ext}, and
        \texttt{fe-iiee-local-int}, corresponding to $S$ and $S'$
        surfaces respectively.
